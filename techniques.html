            <p>
                <spam>Normal Punch</spam>: Saitama punches his opponent. Even though Saitama puts very little to no effort into his punch, it is still strong enough to kill almost every opponent, including Dragon-Level threats, blowing apart their bodies, crushing
                their skulls and bones or even beheading them. When facing humans however, Saitama holds back greatly, only using enough strength to knock them out.
            </p>
            <p>
                <spam>Serious Punch</spam>: Saitama throws an extremely powerful punch. The full extent of this attack is unknown, as it has never directly hit an opponent. It was so powerful that it completely negated Boros's Collapsing Star Roaring Cannon,
                a beam capable of wiping out an entire planet.The shock wave from the punch alone was powerful enough to part the clouds on a global scale, as well as deliver the final fatal blow to Boros. The dying Boros also declared that Saitama's
                fatal attack on him was not even anywhere near Saitama's true power and that Saitama was still holding back.
