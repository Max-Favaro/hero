                <spam>Speed-o-Sound Sonic</spam>: Saitama is his eternal rival and enemy, and contantly train in order to become strong enough to defeat him. They met when Sonic was hired to kill the Hammerhead's group, thinking Saitama was a member because
                of his baldness. With no effort, Saitama defeated him, and afterwards he's been trying in hope that someday, he will defeat Saitama.
            </p>
            <p>
                <spam>Boros</spam>: Saitama was disgusted by the alien's actions and got bored of hearing his life story, which prompted him to kill the alien invader. Boros, on the other hand, views Saitama as the one who puts an end to his boredom and can
                give him a real challenge. Upon meeting, the two started fighting and Boros could surprisingly stand against Saitama for a short period, even surviving many punches from him, but Saitama did not find true joy on their battle, as Boros
                was terrible below him in terms of power and skills. Saitama sympathizes with him because of their mutual lack of challenge and thrill, which made Saitama hold during their brawling.
