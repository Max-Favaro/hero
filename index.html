                Saitama was originally an regular student who just started his first year in middle school. There, he had the misfortune of being robbed of 200 Yen by the local delinquents. After hearing one of the bullies mentioning that his family was impoverished,
                he runs after the creature to get his wallet back and was tackled to the ground as the monster made his escape. Faced with his ineptitude, he proclaims that he'll become an hero. <br>10 years later, he actually gets his
                chance to be one by saving an child from being killed by Crablante. He then commits to becoming stronger via a strict training regimen after realizing how outmatched he was. Unknown to him, the child told his grandfather about the incident
                and decided to create the Hero Association in Saitama's honor for saving his grandchild from the monster's crime. <br>Within 300 days of exercising, he was strong enough to win his fights with moderate effort and he started to go bald.
                <br> He also saved King from Octopus Claw Man and defeated it. Within the same time period, he also follows a crowd into a shelter in Z-City with the expectation that they'll lead him to a monster.
