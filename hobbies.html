                <spam>Initially just a hero for fun</spam>: Since his superhero work began to bore him, he is constantly searching for an opponent that can actually provide him with a challenge. The lack of any such opponents has led him to suffer from a self-imposed
                existential crisis, and he claims that his ability to feel any and all emotions has dulled considerably. He stated that he just became a hero because it was his dream and for self-satisfaction and that before becoming one, he used to suffer
                from anxiety issues. Despite his boredom, Saitama goes out of his way to stop crime.

            <p>
                <spam>Buying in the supermarket and Cleaning his house</spam>: He shows a measure of concern when it comes to bargains and deals, as seen when he fought Carnage Kabuto, when he was more shocked upon the realization that he was going to miss
                a bargain sale, rather than his opponent, who had undergone a transformation and was whacking him around.
